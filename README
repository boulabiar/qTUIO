1. Introduction
qTUIO is a library which implements a TUIO listener on a local UDP socket and forwards the 
events into the internal eventsystem of Qt. 


2. Usage
- 	build the library (see steps after this chapter)
- 	put library and header into convinient places (since there is no make install yet you have to manually
	make the files visible to the system). This could be your application directory, or the systemdirectory
	for libraries and includes.
-	Modify you main.cpp to start a qTUIO thread (see examples) which sends the events to a specific
	target.
-	build your program while linking against the library. If you use qmake you can also check the examples
-	run your programm and provide it with TUIO packets


3. Building the library
Linux:
-	check out the latest version of qTUIO
	$> git clone git://github.com/x29a/qTUIO.git
-	change into the src/ directory and generate a Makefile with qmake
	$> cd qTUIO/src && qmake
-	make the library
	$> make
-	copy the library to a path of your choice and include it in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	$> mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/qTUIO
	$> cp -r ../lib/* /usr/local/lib/qTUIO
	$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib/qTUIO:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
