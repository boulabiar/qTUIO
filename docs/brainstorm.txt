This file is intended as a place for brainstorming about qTUIO, an implementation of the TUIO protocol for QT

Goals:
- Make a class/widget/template/... which translates TUIO Events to native QT Multitouch Events
- modular design so it can be adopted to further versions of TUIO or can be included in QT

How:
- open source (maybe LGPL license)
- QT/C++ obviously
- reimplement TUIO client (use QTNetwork class and oscpack directly)? (idea from Ross Bencina)
- As platform independant as QT is
- cmake/qmake?

Todo:
- Documentation
- check License!!!
- Test windows/mac
- dials not working
- gestures?
